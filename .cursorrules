## PROD AI — Cursor Rules

These rules guide AI-driven edits for the PROD AI frontend.

### Purpose & Scope

- Build a productivity and culture management platform that uses autonomous AI agents to drive engagement, performance, retention, and organizational alignment.
- Integrate with workplace tools to deliver real-time productivity insights, morale analysis, performance gamification, and AI-driven coaching.

### Tech Stack & Constraints

- React (TypeScript, Vite). Always use functional React components and hooks.
- Tailwind CSS for styling. Prefer utility classes; avoid custom CSS unless necessary.
- shadcn/ui as the component library. Follow its composition patterns and naming.
- TanStack Query for API/server state. No custom fetch wrappers that duplicate Query features.
- Zustand for client UI/local state. Keep server state in TanStack Query.
- Zod for schema and form validation. Co-locate schemas near usage or under `shared/typings`.
- XState for onboarding flows only (statecharts for complex onboarding logic).
- React Icons for icons. Use a consistent icon pack per feature.
- Vercel for deployment. Keep SPA-friendly code and avoid Node-only APIs in the client.

### Architecture & Folder Structure

Mirror and extend this structure as features are added:

```text
public/
  assets/
    images/
    icons/
    fonts/
src/
  components/           # shadcn/ui-based shared components
  pages/                # general pages
  layout/
    dashboard/
    settings/
  shared/
    pages/
    components/
    utils/
    typings/
  super-admin/
    pages/
    components/
    utils/
    typings/
  hr/
    pages/
    components/
    utils/
    typings/
  team-member/
    pages/
    components/
    utils/
    typings/
  team-leader/
    pages/
    components/
    utils/
    typings/
  config/               # Zustand stores, TanStack Query client/config
```

Rules:

- Place role-specific UI and logic under the corresponding role folder.
- Place cross-cutting UI in `shared/components` and utilities in `shared/utils`.
- Keep global config (query client, stores) in `src/config`.

### Reusable Components (targets)

- Task card, Daily Mood check-in, Weekly streak, Progress bar
- Auth/Onboarding card, Select role card, Progress stepper
- Team card (onboarding), View team card
- View member page, View team page
- Task review card, Meeting card, Mood card
- Tabs (settings), Tabs, Mood emoji card
- Team analysis card, Status card, Flight risk card, Wellness trend card

When creating these:

- Use shadcn/ui primitives; compose with Tailwind utilities.
- Keep components focused; lift server state to TanStack Query, local UI state to Zustand.
- Co-locate component-specific types and Zod schemas.

### Pages & Layouts

- Maintain top-level `layout/` for `dashboard` and `settings` shells.
- Implement role-based pages under respective role folders; reuse `shared/components`.
- Ensure authentication flow and profile screens live under `pages/` or role folders as appropriate.

### Data & State Conventions

- TanStack Query: define stable query keys (arrays), set sensible `staleTime`/`gcTime` per resource, and use `select` for derived data.
- Mutations must optimistically update cache where appropriate and roll back on error.
- Zustand: create small, focused stores; avoid duplicating server state.
- Zod: validate API payloads and forms; infer TS types from schemas where useful.
- XState: restrict to onboarding; model steps, guards, and side effects explicitly.

### Styling & Accessibility

- Tailwind first. Extract small UI helpers only when duplication grows.
- Use semantic HTML and shadcn/ui accessible primitives.
- Support keyboard navigation and proper ARIA where needed.

### TypeScript & Naming

- Prefer explicit types on public APIs/exports; avoid `any`.
- File casing: PascalCase for React component files; kebab-case for non-component modules.
- Component names are PascalCase; hooks prefixed with `use`.

### SEO & Index

- Keep `index.html` meta tags aligned with product purpose/scope.
- Use Open Graph and Twitter tags; update titles/descriptions per feature rollout if needed.

### Repository & Deployment

- Frontend repo is hosted on GitHub.
- Deploy via Vercel with preview deployments from feature branches.

### Non-Goals

- Do not introduce alternative UI libraries or CSS frameworks beyond shadcn/ui + Tailwind.
- Do not add routing/state libs beyond the specified stack without approval.
